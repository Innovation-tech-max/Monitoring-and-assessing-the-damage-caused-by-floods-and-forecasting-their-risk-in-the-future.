Sentinel-1 is a constellation of European Space Agency (ESA) satellites that provide high-quality Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with high temporal and spatial resolution. This makes Sentinel-1 an ideal data source for studying floods, which are highly dynamic and often occur in remote or hard-to-reach areas."
